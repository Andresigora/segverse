The main goal of the Customer Profile Segmentation is to identify more precisely who the best customers are. It is a k-means clustering segmentation.

The proposed segmentation utilizes customer's data for income, spendings on products and customer's age within the website, here called seniority.

* User retention as Stars;

*   Promoting users between the different levels.
