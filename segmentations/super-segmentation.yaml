description: "
The main goal of the Super Segmentation is to identify more precisely who are our best customers at iFood. It is a simple frequency and monetary value matrix.

The proposed segmentation utilizes total completed orders by the customer and paid amount by the customer over the last 91 days to generate 5 distinct groups:
**Explorers**, **Bronze**, **Silver**, **Gold** and **Platinum**. The last 4 constitute a larger group we call **Super-Clients**, hence the segmentation name.
With this segmentation we can work on 2 main fronts:

* User retention as Super-Client;

* Promoting users between the different levels.
